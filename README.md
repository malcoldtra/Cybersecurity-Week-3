## Notes

This lab has been the easiest (and most fun!) for me because there was a lot of feedback to our actions through the "Inspect Element" function. 

The most difficult part was not being able to understand the instructions when things like "event handlers" were mentioned because I didn't know enough about HTML to what event handlers were.

## Installation Instructions

Setup instructions can be found on the Week 3 Lab page.

It should be noted that any browser can be used; however, Chrome and Firefox have one the most user-friendly Inspect Element interfaces.
